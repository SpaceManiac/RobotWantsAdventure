Robot Wants Kitty: Adventure Edition originally arose from all the demands for a Robot Wants Kitty level editor. I decided to take the original Robot Wants Kitty competition code (zip file) and expand it, adding an options menu for changing a multitude of game settings and selecting from different levels. At first, levels had to be saved as bitmaps, converted with a special program, and hardcoded into the game. Thanks to some PHP power and an SQLite database, users can now upload levels and have them submitted for moderator approval automatically!
